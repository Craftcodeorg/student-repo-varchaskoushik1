# Lecture: Examples of Successful EdTech Projects

## 1. Learning Objectives:
By the end of this lecture, learners will be able to:
- Identify and describe successful EdTech projects that incorporate coding.
- Understand how storytelling can enhance coding education for kids.
- Recognize the impact of these projects on learning experiences and engagement.

## 2. Introduction:
In today’s digital age, coding is becoming an essential skill, and the integration of technology in education (EdTech) is revolutionizing how we teach and learn. This lecture will explore successful EdTech projects that demonstrate the real-world applications of coding, particularly in engaging young learners through storytelling. Understanding these examples is crucial for aspiring educators like you, as they not only inspire innovative teaching methods but also show how coding can be made accessible and fun for children. 

As you aim to teach coding to kids, these projects will provide insight into how to create engaging learning experiences that resonate with your interests in storytelling and game-based learning.

## 3. Core Concepts:
### A. Definition of EdTech Projects
EdTech projects are initiatives that leverage technology to enhance educational outcomes. They often involve interactive tools, applications, or platforms designed to make learning more engaging.

### B. Successful Examples of EdTech Projects
1. **Scratch**
   - **Overview**: Scratch is a free programming language developed by MIT that allows children to create their own interactive stories, games, and animations.
   - **Importance**: It fosters creativity and problem-solving skills while teaching the fundamentals of coding in a playful environment.
  
2. **Code.org**
   - **Overview**: Code.org offers a variety of coding courses for students of all ages, emphasizing fun and engaging activities.
   - **Importance**: Their Hour of Code initiative introduces students to coding through interactive tutorials that often incorporate storytelling elements.

### C. Storytelling in EdTech
- **Why it Matters**: Storytelling can make coding more relatable and engaging for kids. By framing coding tasks within a narrative, learners can better understand the purpose and application of their skills.

## 4. Practical Application:
### Example: Creating a Story with Scratch
Imagine a project where students create a short animated story using Scratch. They can:
- Design characters and backgrounds.
- Write dialogue and program character movements using coding blocks.

Here’s a simple code snippet for moving a character:

```scratch
when green flag clicked
repeat 10
    move 10 steps
    wait 0.5 seconds
end
```

This snippet shows how to animate a character moving across the screen, which can be part of their storytelling project.

## 5. Summary:
In this lecture, we explored successful EdTech projects like Scratch and Code.org that effectively incorporate coding into engaging learning experiences. We highlighted the importance of storytelling in making coding relatable and enjoyable for children. Remember, these examples not only serve as inspiration but also as practical models for your future teaching endeavors.

## 6. Next Steps:
In our next lecture, we will delve into "Integrating Storytelling into Coding Lessons," where we will explore methods to effectively weave narratives into your coding curriculum. To prepare, think about a story idea you would like to turn into a coding project. Consider how you could structure it to engage young learners effectively!
