# Module Title: Real-World Applications of Coding in Education

## Exercise Requirements

### 1. Problem Statement
Design a game that teaches math through coding challenges. Your game should incorporate elements of storytelling and gamification to engage kids aged 8-15. Consider using platforms like Scratch or Code.org, which were discussed in the lecture. The game should include various math challenges that players must solve by writing code to progress through the story.

### 2. Fill-in-the-Blank Starter Code
Below is a starter code snippet for a simple math challenge game using Scratch. You will need to fill in the blanks to complete the functionality.

```scratch
// Starter code for implementing math challenges in a game
when green flag clicked
say [Welcome to the Math Adventure Game!] for 2 seconds

// Ask the player a math question
ask [What is 5 + 3?] and wait
if <answer = _______> then
    say [Correct! You've earned 10 points!] for 2 seconds
    // Add points to the player's score
    set [score v] to (score + _______)
else
    say [Oops! Try again!] for 2 seconds
end

// Display the player's score
say [Your current score is: ] + (score) for 2 seconds
```

### 3. Hints
- **Hint 1**: Recall the basic arithmetic operations you can use to create math challenges. Think about how you can represent addition in your code.
- **Hint 2**: Use variables to keep track of the player's score. Make sure to initialize the score variable before adding points.
- **Hint 3**: Consider how you can provide feedback to the player based on their answer. Use conditional statements to check if their response is correct.

### 4. Expected Outcome
By completing this exercise, students should be able to:
- Fill in the blanks correctly, demonstrating their understanding of how to create a simple math game using coding.
- Implement basic arithmetic operations and conditional logic in their code.
- Create a fun and interactive learning experience that combines math and coding, engaging kids aged 8-15 while reinforcing their math skills.

The final solution should adhere to best practices, include error handling, and be well-commented to explain the reasoning behind each step, as emphasized in the lecture.

## Integration
This exercise is structured to align with the learning objectives outlined in the lecture. It encourages critical thinking and practical application of coding concepts in an engaging context suitable for EdTech. The use of storytelling and gamification elements will help students create captivating learning experiences for young learners.
