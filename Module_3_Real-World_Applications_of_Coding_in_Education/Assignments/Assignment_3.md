### Assignment: Designing a Coding Lesson Plan Integrating Math Tutoring with Programming Concepts

#### Problem Statement:
Create a coding lesson plan that integrates math tutoring with programming concepts using Scratch. The lesson should focus on teaching kids aged 8-15 how to use coding to solve basic math problems through interactive storytelling. The goal is to engage students in both math and coding by having them create a game where characters solve math puzzles to progress through a story.

#### Starter Code:
Below is a basic framework for a Scratch project that students will build upon. This code snippet illustrates how to create a simple interactive story where a character asks a math question and waits for the player's answer.

```scratch
when green flag clicked
say [Welcome to the Math Adventure! Can you help me solve a math puzzle?] for 3 seconds
ask [What is 5 + 3?] and wait
if <answer = 8> then
    say [Correct! Let's move on!] for 2 seconds
else
    say [Oops! That's not right. Try again!] for 2 seconds
end
```

#### Detailed Instructions:
1. **Introduction to the Lesson Plan**: 
   - Begin with an engaging introduction that explains the importance of math in everyday life and how coding can help visualize and solve math problems.
   - Discuss the learning objectives: understanding addition, subtraction, and basic coding principles.

2. **Modify the Starter Code**:
   - **Step 1**: Expand the questions by adding more math problems. Use the `ask` block multiple times to create a series of questions.
   - **Step 2**: Add conditions for different answers, including correct and incorrect responses. Use `if-else` statements to provide feedback based on the player's answer.
   - **Step 3**: Incorporate different math operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication) into the game. For example:
     ```scratch
     ask [What is 7 - 2?] and wait
     if <answer = 5> then
         say [Great job! You solved it!] for 2 seconds
     else
         say [Not quite! Give it another shot!] for 2 seconds
     end
     ```

3. **Enhance the Storyline**:
   - **Step 4**: Create a narrative that connects the math problems. For example, after each correct answer, the character could move to a new scene or meet another character who presents the next challenge.
   - **Step 5**: Use Scratch's backdrop feature to change scenes based on the player's progress in solving math problems.

4. **Add Gamification Elements**:
   - **Step 6**: Introduce points or rewards for correct answers using variables. For instance, create a variable called `score` that increases by one each time the player answers correctly.
   - **Step 7**: At the end of the game, display the total score and provide encouragement or feedback based on performance.

#### Criteria for Success and Evaluation:
- **Success Criteria**:
  - The lesson plan effectively integrates math tutoring with programming concepts.
  - The Scratch project includes multiple math questions with appropriate feedback for correct and incorrect answers.
  - The storyline is engaging and encourages students to think critically about math problems.
  - The code is clean, well-structured, and follows best practices in Scratch programming.
  
- **Evaluation Rubric**:
  - **Content Relevance (30%)**: Does the lesson plan clearly connect math concepts with coding?
  - **Creativity (30%)**: Is the storyline engaging and imaginative?
  - **Functionality (20%)**: Does the Scratch project work as intended without errors?
  - **Clarity of Instructions (20%)**: Are the instructions clear and easy to follow?

This assignment encourages hands-on practice while reinforcing the concepts learned in the lecture on using technology to enhance learning experiences. It also aligns with your career goal of teaching coding to kids, providing a practical application of coding skills in an educational context.
