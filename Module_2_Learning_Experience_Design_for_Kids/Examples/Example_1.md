### Module Title: Learning Experience Design for Kids

---

### Required Example Details

1. **Introduction**
   The concept of "Example 1: Designing a storyboard for an educational game" is pivotal in the context of Learning Experience Design (LED). In the lecture titled "Principles of Learning Experience Design," we emphasized the importance of creating engaging and effective educational environments for kids. By utilizing storyboards, educators can map out the narrative flow and interactive elements of an educational game, ensuring that coding concepts are not only taught but also experienced in a fun and relatable way. This approach aligns with key LED principles such as learner-centered design and active learning, making complex subjects like coding accessible and enjoyable for young learners.

2. **Code Snippet**
   Below is a well-commented code snippet that demonstrates how to create a simple educational game framework using Python. This code illustrates how to design a storyboard for an interactive game where kids can make choices that influence the outcome.

   ```python
   class Character:
       def __init__(self, name):
           self.name = name
           self.position = 0  # Starting position in the game

       def move(self, direction):
           """Move the character left or right based on user input."""
           if direction == "right":
               self.position += 1
               print(f"{self.name} moves right to position {self.position}.")
           elif direction == "left":
               self.position -= 1
               print(f"{self.name} moves left to position {self.position}.")
           else:
               print(f"{self.name} stays put at position {self.position}.")

   def main():
       # Create a character instance
       hero = Character("Hero")

       # Game loop
       while True:
           user_input = input("Enter 'right', 'left', or 'stay' (type 'exit' to quit): ").strip().lower()
           if user_input == 'exit':
               print("Exiting the game. Goodbye!")
               break
           elif user_input in ['right', 'left', 'stay']:
               hero.move(user_input)
           else:
               print("Invalid input! Please enter 'right', 'left', or 'stay'.")

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       main()
   ```

3. **Explanation**
   - **Character Class**: The `Character` class represents a game character with attributes such as `name` and `position`. This encapsulates the concept of learner-centered design by allowing students to create characters they relate to.
   - **Move Method**: The `move` method facilitates active learning by allowing kids to input commands that affect the character's position. It incorporates error handling by checking for valid input and providing feedback.
   - **Main Function**: This function initiates a game loop where users can interact with the character. It reinforces feedback and iteration by responding to user inputs and updating the character's state accordingly.
   - **User Input Handling**: The program prompts users for input, demonstrating contextual learning by situating coding within an engaging narrative framework.

4. **Application**
   This concept can be applied in EdTech through the development of educational games that teach coding fundamentals. By designing storyboards for these games, educators can create structured learning experiences that engage kids in problem-solving and critical thinking. For example, a game could be built around a popular children's story where students must code their way through challenges that mirror the plot, enhancing their understanding of coding concepts while fostering creativity and collaboration.
