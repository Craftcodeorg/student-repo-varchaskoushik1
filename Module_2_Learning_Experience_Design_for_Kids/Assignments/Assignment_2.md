### Assignment: Design a Math Game that Uses Coding Logic to Solve Problems

#### Problem Statement:
Create an interactive math game for kids aged 8-15 that incorporates storytelling elements and coding logic. The game should involve a character who needs to solve math problems to progress through a story. For instance, the character could be a treasure hunter who must solve math puzzles to unlock treasures or move past obstacles. The game will not only teach math concepts but also engage children through a captivating narrative.

#### Starter Code:
Below is a basic framework for your math game using Python. This code sets up the environment and includes comments to guide you in expanding the game.

```python
import random

# Starter code for the Math Adventure Game

def start_game():
    print("Welcome to the Math Adventure Game!")
    print("Your mission is to help the treasure hunter solve math problems to find the treasure!")
    character_name = input("What is your character's name? ")
    print(f"Great! Let's start the adventure, {character_name}!")

    # Call the first challenge
    first_challenge(character_name)

def first_challenge(character_name):
    # Generate a simple math problem
    num1 = random.randint(1, 10)
    num2 = random.randint(1, 10)
    correct_answer = num1 + num2

    print(f"\n{character_name}, you encounter a magical gate that asks:")
    print(f"What is {num1} + {num2}?")
    
    # Get user's answer
    user_answer = int(input("Your answer: "))
    
    if user_answer == correct_answer:
        print("Correct! The gate opens, and you can proceed.")
        # Call next challenge or end game
    else:
        print(f"Oops! The correct answer was {correct_answer}. Try again!")
        first_challenge(character_name)  # Restart the challenge

# Start the game
start_game()
```

#### Detailed Instructions:
1. **Enhance the Storyline**: Add more challenges that involve different math operations (subtraction, multiplication, division) and create a narrative around each challenge. For example, after solving the first problem, the character could meet a dragon that asks another math question.

2. **Create Multiple Levels**: Modify the game to include multiple levels of difficulty. For instance, introduce larger numbers or more complex problems as the player progresses.

3. **Add a Scoring System**: Implement a scoring system that rewards players for correct answers and provides feedback on their performance.

4. **Include Visual Elements**: Consider using libraries like Pygame to add graphics and make the game visually appealing. This could include character animations or background images that enhance the storytelling aspect.

5. **Test Your Game**: After implementing your features, playtest your game to ensure it is engaging and educational. Gather feedback from kids in your target age group to refine the experience.

#### Criteria for Success and Evaluation:
- **Engagement**: The game should capture children's interest through an engaging storyline and interactive challenges.
- **Educational Value**: The math problems should be age-appropriate and effectively teach mathematical concepts.
- **Functionality**: The code should run without errors, and all features should work as intended.
- **Code Quality**: The code should be clean, well-organized, and include comments explaining each part of the program.
- **User Feedback**: Gather feedback from at least three kids after they play your game to assess their enjoyment and learning experience.

By completing this assignment, you will apply storytelling techniques in a coding context while creating an educational tool that aligns with your career goals in EdTech. Good luck, and have fun coding!
