### Assignment: Storytelling and Game Mechanics in Coding for Kids

#### Problem Statement:
Create an interactive coding project that combines storytelling with game mechanics to teach kids aged 8-15 the basics of coding. The project will involve designing a simple text-based adventure game where players navigate through a story by making choices that affect the outcome. This will allow students to apply the concepts of Game-Based Learning (GBL) discussed in the lecture, specifically focusing on engagement and feedback.

#### Starter Code:
Below is a basic framework for a text-based adventure game. Students will build upon this code to create their own unique story and game mechanics.

```python
# Starter code for a text-based adventure game

def start_game():
    print("Welcome to the Adventure Game!")
    print("You are a brave explorer on a quest to find the lost treasure.")
    first_choice()

def first_choice():
    print("\nYou are at a crossroads. Do you want to go left or right?")
    choice = input("Type 'left' or 'right': ").strip().lower()
    
    if choice == "left":
        left_path()
    elif choice == "right":
        right_path()
    else:
        print("Invalid choice! Please try again.")
        first_choice()

def left_path():
    print("\nYou chose the left path and encountered a dragon!")
    print("Do you want to fight the dragon or run away?")
    choice = input("Type 'fight' or 'run': ").strip().lower()
    
    if choice == "fight":
        print("You bravely fought the dragon and won! You found the treasure!")
    elif choice == "run":
        print("You ran away safely, but you missed the treasure.")
    else:
        print("Invalid choice! Please try again.")
        left_path()

def right_path():
    print("\nYou chose the right path and found a friendly wizard.")
    print("Do you want to ask for help or continue on your own?")
    choice = input("Type 'help' or 'continue': ").strip().lower()
    
    if choice == "help":
        print("The wizard gave you magical powers to find the treasure!")
    elif choice == "continue":
        print("You continued on your own and found the treasure after a long journey!")
    else:
        print("Invalid choice! Please try again.")
        right_path()

# Start the game
start_game()
```

#### Detailed Instructions:
1. **Enhance Storyline**: Modify the `start_game`, `first_choice`, `left_path`, and `right_path` functions to include more detailed narrative elements. Add descriptions of the environment, characters, and events to make the story more engaging.

2. **Add More Choices**: Expand the game by introducing additional choices at each decision point. Create new functions for each new path that players can take. For example, after encountering the dragon, players could also choose to negotiate instead of fighting or running.

3. **Implement Feedback Mechanism**: Introduce a feedback system that informs players about their choices. For example, after each choice, provide a brief summary of what happened as a result of their decision.

4. **Test Your Game**: Run your game multiple times to ensure all paths work correctly and that there are no bugs. Make sure that every choice leads to an appropriate outcome.

5. **Polish and Document**: Clean up your code, ensuring it is well-documented with comments explaining each function's purpose. This will help others understand your code better.

#### Criteria for Success and Evaluation:
- **Functionality**: The game should run without errors and allow players to make choices that affect the outcome.
- **Engagement**: The storyline should be captivating and encourage players to explore different paths.
- **Code Quality**: The code should be clean, well-organized, and follow best practices for readability.
- **Documentation**: Comments should effectively explain what each part of the code does.
- **Feedback Implementation**: The game should provide clear feedback based on player choices, enhancing the learning experience.

This assignment encourages hands-on practice with storytelling and game mechanics while reinforcing coding concepts in an engaging way for young learners.
