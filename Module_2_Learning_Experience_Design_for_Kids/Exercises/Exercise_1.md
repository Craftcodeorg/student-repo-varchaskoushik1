# Module Title: Learning Experience Design for Kids

## Exercise Requirements

### 1. Problem Statement
You are tasked with developing a storyboard for an educational game that teaches coding concepts to kids aged 8-15. The game should incorporate storytelling elements that resonate with children and utilize the principles of Learning Experience Design (LED) discussed in the lecture. 

**Scenario**: Imagine a game where players help a young hero navigate through a magical forest filled with challenges that require coding solutions. Players will encounter different characters from popular children's stories who will provide coding challenges that relate to their narratives. Your storyboard should outline the game's flow, key interactions, and how coding concepts will be integrated into the storyline.

### 2. Fill-in-the-Blank Starter Code
Provide starter code that incorporates a basic game mechanic where the player can choose a direction to move based on coding logic. The code should be structured to allow for storytelling elements to be added later.

```python
# Starter code for implementing storytelling in a coding game
def move_character(direction):
    # Determine the character's movement based on the chosen direction
    if direction == "right":
        print("The character moves right into the enchanted grove!")
    elif direction == "left":
        print("The character moves left towards the wise old tree!")
    elif direction == "forward":
        print("The character moves forward into the mysterious fog!")
    else:
        print("The character stays put, pondering their next move.")

# Example usage - The player chooses a direction
move_character("______")  # Fill in with "right", "left", or "forward"
```

### 3. Hints
- **Hint 1**: Think about how you can use character choices to affect the game's storyline. Each direction could lead to a different challenge or character interaction.
- **Hint 2**: Consider how you can integrate coding logic within each challenge. For example, if a character asks for help with a simple math problem, how can you guide the player to write code that solves it?
- **Hint 3**: Remember the principles of active learning and feedback from the lecture. How can you provide immediate feedback to players based on their choices?

### 4. Expected Outcome
The student should be able to fill in the blanks correctly, demonstrating an understanding of how coding concepts apply to interactive storytelling in an educational game. The final solution should:
- Include well-structured code that adheres to best practices.
- Incorporate error handling for unexpected inputs.
- Be well-commented to explain the reasoning behind each step, emphasizing how the chosen direction influences the storyline and coding challenges.
