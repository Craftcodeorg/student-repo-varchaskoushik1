### Module Title: Introduction to Coding for Kids

### Exercise Requirements

#### 1. Problem Statement
Create an interactive game using Scratch that allows players to navigate a character through a maze. The game should utilize events and controls to respond to user inputs, such as keyboard arrows, to move the character. The goal is to teach children about basic programming concepts while engaging them in storytelling through the game's narrative.

**Scenario**: Imagine you are a tutor guiding kids aged 8-15 in creating their own maze game. The game will include a story where the character must find their way out of a magical forest by collecting items along the way. Each item collected will provide hints or help the character advance.

#### 2. Fill-in-the-Blank Starter Code
Below is a starter code snippet for Scratch that outlines how to set up the character movement and item collection. Fill in the blanks to complete the functionality.

```scratch
// Starter code for implementing game mechanics
when [up arrow v] key pressed
    change y by _______ // Move character up

when [down arrow v] key pressed
    change y by _______ // Move character down

when [right arrow v] key pressed
    change x by _______ // Move character right

when [left arrow v] key pressed
    change x by _______ // Move character left

if <touching [item v]?> then
    // Collect the item
    say [I found an item!] for (2) seconds
    change [score v] by _______ // Increase score by 1
```

#### 3. Hints
- **Hint 1**: For movement, think about how many steps you want your character to move each time an arrow key is pressed. What is a reasonable number?
- **Hint 2**: When checking if the character is touching an item, think about what happens when they collect it. What should increase when they collect an item?
- **Hint 3**: Remember to keep your game engaging! You might want to add sounds or animations when the character collects an item or reaches a goal.

#### 4. Expected Outcome
Students should fill in the blanks correctly, demonstrating their understanding of event handling and control structures in Scratch. The completed code will allow the character to move in response to keyboard inputs and collect items, enhancing their storytelling experience within the game. The final solution should adhere to best practices, including clear comments explaining each part of the code and how it relates to the overall game mechanics.

### Integration
This exercise is designed to engage students with project-based learning, allowing them to apply coding concepts in a fun and interactive way. By creating a maze game, they will not only learn about programming languages suitable for kids but also enhance their creativity and problem-solving skills through storytelling and game design.
