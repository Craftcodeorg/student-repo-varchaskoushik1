### Module Title: Introduction to Coding for Kids

---

### Exercise Requirements

#### 1. Problem Statement:
Create a Scratch project that introduces yourself. In this project, you will utilize coding concepts such as algorithms, variables, and storytelling to design an interactive introduction. Your project should allow users to click on different parts of your introduction to reveal more about you, making it an engaging experience for kids aged 8-15.

**Scenario**: Imagine you are a character in a game where players can learn about you by interacting with various elements. Each interaction will showcase a different aspect of your personality or interests, using the coding concepts discussed in the lecture.

#### 2. Fill-in-the-Blank Starter Code:
Hereâ€™s a simplified version of what your Scratch project might look like in pseudocode. Fill in the blanks to complete the functionality.

```plaintext
# Starter code for implementing your introduction project
WHEN green flag clicked
    SET name = "_________"  # Your name
    SET age = _______       # Your age
    SET hobby = "_________" # Your favorite hobby

    # Display the introduction
    SAY "Hello! My name is " + name + ". I am " + age + " years old and I love " + hobby + "!"

    # Create interactive elements
    WHEN sprite clicked
        SAY "I enjoy coding because it allows me to create fun projects!"
```

#### 3. Hints:
- **Hint 1**: Remember that variables are used to store information that can change. Think about what personal information you want to include in your introduction.
- **Hint 2**: Use the `SAY` block in Scratch to display messages. You can concatenate strings to create dynamic messages.
- **Hint 3**: For the interactive part, consider using the `WHEN sprite clicked` event to make your project more engaging. What would you like to say when someone clicks on your character?

#### 4. Expected Outcome:
By completing this exercise, you should be able to:
- Create a Scratch project that effectively introduces yourself using coding concepts such as variables and algorithms.
- Demonstrate an understanding of storytelling by making your introduction interactive and engaging.
- Show how coding can be used as a tool for self-expression and creativity, aligning with your goals of teaching coding to kids.

The final project should be well-commented to explain the reasoning behind each step, demonstrating your ability to teach these concepts effectively.
